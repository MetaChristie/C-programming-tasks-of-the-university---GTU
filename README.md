# C-programming-tasks-of-the-university---GTU
I decided to post this repository with good intentions. I just want to publish a solution to very simple programming problems. This will be especially helpful for beginners.
And I ask for reviews from professionals.

The problems are not explained in the comments, but they are so interesting and simple that everything is clear from reading the code.
